    <h1>About-me</h1>
    <div class="intro"> 
    <p>I was born the 1<sup>st</sup> of September 2005,(not a very lucky day to have your birthday on)in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. There were some problems with this date, as it is a school day i never could do a whole day bithday and i never wanted to wait until the weekends so i had to do it on the birth day.</p>

    <div class="family">
        <p>I have 2 sisters, Zere, my older sister and Karina, my younger sister, 16 and 11 years. My father's name is Marlen and my mothers's name is Ainagul. It is quite boring having 2 sisters and 7 girls cousins and just 2 boys cousins who are younger than 5 years while i am 13. But i somehow survive) </p>

    <div class="live">
        <p>Despite being born in Kazakhstan, right now i am living in Valencia, Spain. You would maybe want to know why, it's due to my older sister's professional tennis trainings. In Spain, the level of tennis is much better than in Kazakhstan so we decided to move, but the warmer climate has its role too. </p>

    <div class="school">
        <p>On the first day of school i was very nervous, i did't know anyone and i didn't know Spanish yet. I was in a foreign country, with no knowledge of their language, the only thing that kept me alive was the fact that it was an English school, and i knew English quite well. But still, i couldn't here any English speech. Luckily, my new classmates helped me out and introduced me to all the class. Now, after 3 years of living in Spain, i speak Spanish fluently</p>
