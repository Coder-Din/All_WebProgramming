<h1>My School</h1>

<div class="intro">
 <p>I learn in El Plantio, it is situated in Valencia, Spain. I learn in Year 9 and my tudor's name is Mercedez and she is Spanish. Apart from being our tudor, she is our Science teacher and a Chemistry teacher to higher classes. </p>
</div>

<div class="fsubjects">
<p>My favourite subjects are Physical Education, Art and Maths but if i had to choose only one, i would choose Physical Education, i really like it. Especially the days when we are allowed to do any sport we choose and it is always football, only football and nothing else. </p>
</div>

<div class="hsubjects">
<p>I hate History, it is so null. We don't do anything interesting, only reading and doing exercises which are provided to us by our teacher in a very boring way. You will not ever hear a joke from History teacher.</p> </div>
